INSTALLING PROCESSING CONTRIBUTED LIBRARIES

	if you do not know how to install processing libraries, here is how:
	http://www.learningprocessing.com/tutorials/libraries/
	or
	http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library


Libraries you will need to run my program:


SAITO OBJ LOADER
-http://code.google.com/p/saitoobjloader/
	-this is being used in my program to attach meshes i have made in maya to the character that is being tracked by 		
	 the kinect and displayed in the application window.

SIMPLE OPENNI (OPENNI library wrapper for Processing)
-http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/
	first download the OpenNI_NITE zip package appropriate for your system architecture, unzip the archive and run 
	the install.sh file (the install.sh file will simply run a bash script in the console to put the openi and nite 
	files in the correct directory configuration) then download the SimpleOpenNI-0.26.zip and extract all files. 
	Once all files have been extracted, copy the "library" folder to the "libraries" directory, which should be 
	located in which ever directory you have specified for your Processing sketches. (Normally in /Users/usernam
	/Documents/Processing/")

DANIEL SHIFFMAN KINECT (Optional but recommended)
-http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/
	his tutorials are also very helpful in getting started with not only his libraries but the general idea and 
	mechanics of the kinect itself.

A FEW NOTES ON COMPATIBILITY:


Processing 2.0a4 will not play nicely with older versions of opengl calls made through java (JOGL functions) - in fact, opengl in general tends to be more than a bit sluggish with any version of Processing later than 1.5.1 ...

As far as the IDE is concerned, Processing's IDE is advised; however, other Java-friendly IDEs are just fine
(i.e. Eclipse, netbeans, command line, etc) Do note that your project will have a different setup or file hierarchy when migrating code to different development environments.

These are the operating systems on which this project has been tested:
	Mac OSX - 10.6.* (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion)
	Windows 7 is something i have on my TODO list
	Ubuntu 11.14 and 12.04 is also something i have on my TODO list
